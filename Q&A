1. What does Netdata monitor?

Netdata monitors a wide range of system and application metrics in real time, such as:

CPU usage (per core, load average)
Memory (used, cached, swap)
Disk (I/O, read/write, usage)
Network (bandwidth, packets, errors)
Processes (per PID, top apps)
Docker/Kubernetes containers (resource usage per container)
Databases, web servers, apps (via collectors)

2Ô∏è. How do you view real-time metrics?

Netdata provides a web-based dashboard at http://<server-ip>:19999.
Metrics are displayed as interactive charts that update per second.
You can drill down into details for CPU, RAM, disk, containers, etc.

3Ô∏è. What is a collector?
   collector in Netdata is a plugin that gathers metrics from different sources.

Example collectors:

proc plugin ‚Üí reads Linux /proc files (CPU, memory, etc.)
docker plugin ‚Üí monitors Docker containers
mysql plugin ‚Üí collects MySQL database metrics

Collectors feed data to the dashboard and alerting engine.

4Ô∏è. How is Netdata different from Prometheus?

            Netdata üñ•Ô∏è	                                                  Prometheus üìä
Data collection	Comes with built-in collectors	                  Relies on exporters
Visualization	Real-time charts out of the box              	      Needs Grafana or other tools
Storage	Keeps recent data in RAM (lightweight)            	      Stores long-term time-series data
Use case	Great for real-time monitoring & troubleshooting      	Best for historical analysis & scaling

            In short: Netdata = real-time observability, Prometheus = long-term metrics + alerts.

5Ô∏è. What are some performance KPIs to watch?

Some important KPIs with Netdata:

CPU load (if >80%, system is stressed)
Memory usage (high swap usage = memory bottleneck)
Disk I/O latency (slow disk = bottleneck)
Network throughput (bandwidth utilization, packet drops)
Container metrics (per service resource usage)
System health alarms (built-in thresholds)

6Ô∏è. How to deploy Netdata on a VM?

Install via Docker
            docker run -d --name=netdata -p 19999:19999 netdata/netdata
OR
Install directly on Linux
            bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
Access at ‚Üí http://<vm-ip>:19999

7Ô∏è. How does Netdata alerting work?

Netdata has a health monitoring system with pre-configured alarms (e.g., high CPU, low disk space).
Alerts can be sent via email, Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, etc.
Alarms are defined in YAML configs (health.d directory).
Thresholds are customizable.

8Ô∏è. What is a dashboard in this context?

The dashboard is the web UI where Netdata visualizes metrics.
It‚Äôs interactive, real-time, and auto-refreshing.
You can explore per-second charts, drill into subsystems, and view container metrics in one place.
